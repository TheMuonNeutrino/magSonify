Artifact testing
====================
A series of tests have been performed on the sonification algorithms in order to explore
the artifacts present. These are outlined in IPython notebooks, which core testing code contained
in ``./Tests_Artifacts/baseMethods.py``

Install

The artifact tests are located in ``./Tests_Artifacts``, not in the main package. Clone the github
