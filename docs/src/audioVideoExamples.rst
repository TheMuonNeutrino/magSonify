Audio and Video Examples
--------------------------------

Example audification of the compressional field component for an event starting 2008 12 07, comparing
wavelets based stretch, paulstretch and phase vocoder. The video presents contextual information.

Upper: Waveform of magnetic field - polaroid component. 
Lower: Spectogram of magnetic field. Right: Satelliete position given in units of Earth radii. 
Sun is located in the :math:`-y` direction.

Note in particular the different degrees to which the higher pitch harmonic modes are audible when using
the different algorithms. This is most noticable on the second day.

These are generated using the code in the example file ``./Example Code/devAnimateVideoGeneration.py``.
This requires that you have `ffmpeg <http://ffmpeg.org/>`_ installed in order to run.
